## Motivation ⚡️

The ability to communicate in different languages has always fascinated and impressed me. As an imigrant myself  I have experienced having to learn this skill when I moved from Poland to the UK. Although I had had a decent English language education up to that point, which I had received throughout my years spent in primary and secondary school, as well as the university, the reality of spoken English hit me hard. 

This app is not designed to replace any professional foreign language course, but should be treated as a suplement supporting only development of speaking side of learning process. At the end of the day, I believe that most people want to learn a foreign language to be able to communicate fluently in chosen dialect, which needs to be practiced on a regular basis, like working out in a gym. This app will provide a platform to look for people with similar ambitions and motivation, who are willing to share their time and have a friendly chat with those, who want to learn by speaking without any unnecessary pressure of exams, tests or deadlines!
