                    Well, the best way to explain it is through an example.
                    Pawel is from Poland and has recently moved to London. His
                    English is a bit patchy and he would like to improve it.
                    Oliver is from London and he is learning Polish, but he
                    never has the opportunity to listen and speak to native
                    Polish speakers. Now, Pawel and Oliver could help each other
                    out. For example they can meet up in a caf√© once a week and
                    have a conversation exchange, speaking half an hour in
                    English and half an hour in Polish. There is no cost or
                    homework involved and you learn the language in a social
                    environment. Furthermore, you are more likely to learn slang
                    and other things about a culture that you do not usually
                    learn in a formal language class.
